# Assignment 3

When currently built a testrun for the Schema I/O runs.

-> add a path to a test.sql to the arguments and the test will parse the schema, save it using the buffermanager and load it again

-> additionally the string output is tested for equality to verify the correct saving/loading



The program can also be built to run the slotted page tests provided for Assignment 3
